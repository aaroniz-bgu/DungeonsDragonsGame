# DungeonsDragonsGame
Hi there! Dungeons and Dragons is a game with well-defined game rules and flow, thus me and my friend Daniel-Sachs have tackled a simple version of it in order to practice our object oriented knowledge and design patters knowledge.
It has no dependencies but Java's core/standard library.
Please feel more than welcome to build it on your local machine and play it!
